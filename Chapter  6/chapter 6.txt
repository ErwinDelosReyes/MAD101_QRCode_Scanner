A common widget in Flutter is a widget that people use a lot when building apps. These are things like **Text** for showing words, **Button** for clickable things, **Image** for pictures, **Container** for holding or styling stuff, and **Column** or **Row** for arranging things. They are like the basic building blocks you use to create the look and feel of your app. Since they’re so useful, you’ll see them in almost every Flutter project!
