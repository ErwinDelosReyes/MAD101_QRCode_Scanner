In this chapter, we will learn about the **widget tree**, which is a structure that shows how widgets are organized in an app. Widgets are the building blocks of a user interface, and they are arranged in a tree-like structure where each widget can have parent and child widgets. The parent widget holds and manages its child widgets, and this hierarchy determines how the app looks and behaves. For example, a **Column** widget might have several **Text** widgets as its children, and they all work together to create the layout we see on the screen.
